# CHAPTER 4 OF DOET PART-2


## OVERVIEW
Chapter 4 explains how people figure out what actions are possible when they encounter a new product or system. Norman focuses on how designers can guide users through constraints, signifiers, mappings, and feedback so that the intended actions become clear.

## FORCING FUNCTIONS (STRONG CONSTRAINTS)

### INTERLOCKS
Interlocks force operations to happen in the correct order.

**Examples:**
- Microwave ovens that shut off when the door opens

- Cars that require the brake pedal to be pressed before shifting out of Park

These prevent unsafe or incorrect actions by requiring certain conditions before the next step can occur.

### LOCK-INS
Lock-ins keep an operation active and prevent the user from accidentally stopping it.

**Examples:**
- Applications that ask “Do you want to save before quitting?”

- Systems that block premature exits until essential steps are completed


Lock-ins protect user work and ensure important actions are completed.

---

## LOCKOUTS
Lockouts prevent users from entering dangerous situations or performing unsafe actions.

**Examples:**
- Fire stairways that block access to basements during emergencies
- Childproof cabinet locks, outlet covers, and fire-extinguisher safety pins

Lockouts focus on preventing accidents before they occur.

## WHY THESE CONSTRAINTS MATTER
Effective constraints:
- Reduce user error
- Improve safety
- Make systems predictable
- Support discoverability
- Guide correct actions, even for first-time users

## PERSONAL REFLECTION
This chapter shows that constraints are not about limiting the user, they guide them. Interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts appear in everyday products, and once you understand them, you see them everywhere.

Adding small constraints in design or code (like disabling a button until input is valid) makes interactions clearer and prevents mistakes. Good constraints guide the user without making the system feel restrictive.
